# Blooming Math 🌸🌿

**AI-Powered Handwritten Math Learning Web Application**

An interactive educational platform where children learn mathematics by drawing problems on a canvas while a custom-trained MNIST model (97.82% accuracy) recognizes their handwriting in real-time, all wrapped in a beautiful blooming garden interface.

## 🎯 Project Overview

BloomingMath transforms traditional math learning into an engaging, interactive experience by combining:
- **Custom MNIST Model**: 97.82% accuracy handwritten digit recognition
- **Interactive Canvas**: Natural drawing interface for math problems
- **OpenCV Processing**: Advanced image preprocessing for better recognition
